                    <h3>Bunker works toward our vision by building strength, stability and self-reliance in partnership with communities in need of help and evacuting zone. Bunker help people to move to the right place for the safety of their own families.</h3><br>
                    <h3>Evacuation centers provide temporary shelter for persons displaced from
                        their homes following a disaster. These facilities vary by location and
                        by the extent of damage to the area. Office buildings, sports stadiums,
                        churches, residential homes, dormitories and community centers may all
                        serve as emergency shelters. Evacuees are required to share living spaces,
                        bathrooms and kitchen facilities with others. They may also be exposed
                        to overly crowded conditions, making them vulnerable to outbreaks of
                        infectious diseases.
                        As an evacuee, you can help prevent the spread of infection by taking essential steps.</h3>
